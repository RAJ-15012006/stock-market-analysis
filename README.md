## üìÇ Detailed Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Importing Libraries
The notebook begins by importing essential Python libraries required for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning:
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for handling data structures and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization and understanding distributions.
- **scikit-learn** for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (if used) for advanced deep learning models like LSTM.
- Other utilities for handling date-time data and performance metrics.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Historical stock market data is loaded from CSV or API sources.
- Missing values are handled, outliers removed, and date columns converted to datetime format.
- Features are scaled to standardize input data for machine learning models.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing stock price trends over time using line plots.
- Examining distribution of returns and price fluctuations.
- Performing correlation analysis between different features.
- Identifying seasonal patterns, spikes, and anomalies in the data.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering
- Creating new features like moving averages, volatility, and relative strength index (RSI).
- Adding time-based features such as day, month, and rolling statistics.
- Using lagged variables and window-based aggregations to capture past trends.
- Selecting relevant features to improve model robustness and reduce overfitting.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to validate model performance.
- Implementing machine learning algorithms such as:
   - **Linear Regression** for baseline predictions.
   - **Random Forest** for capturing nonlinear relationships.
   - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** for modeling time-dependent patterns.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters and applying cross-validation techniques.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
- Calculating accuracy and error metrics like:
   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** ‚Äì measures prediction error.
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** ‚Äì gives average error magnitude.
   - **R¬≤ Score** ‚Äì explains the proportion of variance captured by the model.
- Visual comparison between actual and predicted stock prices.
